<p align="left">Since ICT this quarter focused merely on coding, I took this opportunity to improve my skills in coding. I also observed myself and my growth in coding. I got more used to the concept of coding as time goes by because every hands on that we do lets us apply our knowledge from the past lessons to Incorporate it in the browser output we're making. Ms. Uminga's teaching style also served as a big factor in enhancing my coding skills — each and every concept can be understood easily and every activity or hands on allows us to practice coding for that lesson. Despite all the challenges, pressure, and failures, I survived this quarter because of my friends who made everything bearable. When I need help, may it be ICT related or in other subjects, they're always willing to lend a hand. Though we've faced hardships this quarter, I also enjoyed all the activities, groupworks, and events. It allowed me to get to know my classmates better and build a bond with them. It also helped with my collaborative and communication skills. I've also made so many memories with my classmates and teachers which I'll forever treasure. All those tears that I've shed and sadness that I've felt cannot compare to all the laughs I let out and the happiness that will remain in my heart. 
<br> <br>
Overall, I acknowledge all my shortcomings this quarter. I promise to take those as a motivation to strive harder for the next quarter to make myself and the people around me proud. In order to get higher grades, I need to listen well to all my teachers and find a study method that works for me. I'd also need to give in more effort, especially in ICT, and work on my weaknesses. I can also familiarize myself with the teacher's teaching style (e.g way of making a test, giving an activity, etc.) Even though I admit that I am not good in ICT, I will do my very best in the following quarters of this school year. 
<br> <br>
<b> To Ms. Uminga, thank you po for your dedication in teaching us the lessons this quarter. To my friends, thank you for staying by my side each and every day. To my family, thank you for your unwavering support. And lastly, to the Almighty God, whom nothing would be possible if it weren't because of Him. Glory is all His. </b> </p> <br>
