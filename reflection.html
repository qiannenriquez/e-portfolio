<p align="left">Since ICT this quarter focused merely on coding, I took this opportunity to improve my skills in coding. I also observed myself and my growth in coding. I got more used to the concept of coding as time goes by because every hands on that we do lets us apply our knowledge from the past lessons to Incorporate it in the browser output we're making. Ms. Uminga's teaching style also served as a big factor in enhancing my coding skills — each and every concept can be understood easily and every activity or hands on allows us to practice coding for that lesson. Despite all the challenges, pressure, and failures, I survived this quarter because of my friends who made everything bearable. When I need help, may it be ICT related or in other subjects, they're always willing to lend a hand. Though we've faced hardships this quarter, I also enjoyed all the activities, groupworks, and events. It allowed me to get to know my classmates better and build a bond with them. It also helped with my collaborative and communication skills. I've also made so many memories with my classmates and teachers which I'll forever treasure. All those tears that I've shed and sadness that I've felt cannot compare to all the laughs I let out and the happiness that will remain in my heart. 
<br> <br>
Overall, I acknowledge all my shortcomings this quarter. I promise to take those as a motivation to strive harder for the next quarter to make myself and the people around me proud. In order to get higher grades, I need to listen well to all my teachers and find a study method that works for me. I'd also need to give in more effort, especially in ICT, and work on my weaknesses. I can also familiarize myself with the teacher's teaching style (e.g way of making a test, giving an activity, etc.) Even though I admit that I am not good in ICT, I will do my very best in the following quarters of this school year. 
<br> <br>
<b> To Ms. Uminga, thank you po for your dedication in teaching us the lessons this quarter. To my friends, thank you for staying by my side each and every day. To my family, thank you for your unwavering support. And lastly, to the Almighty God, whom nothing would be possible if it weren't because of Him. Glory is all His. </b> </p> <br>

<p align="left">This quarter, we were bombarded with performance tasks, projects, class works, etc., which led us to not be able to focus on some of our classes. Because of these tasks, we weren't able to discuss some topics or do some written works in other subjects, like in ICT. The time lended for these projects were certainly a big help, but there were many missed opportunities to learn and practice coding. Though the topics this quarter are different from the last quarter, I can still apply my knowledge from the past in coding. This quarter, we focused on CSS. I learned that CSS is a big help in designing our webpage and making it look pleasant in the eyes. There were many properties and terms to learn this quarter but I learned that it's important for us so we can be able to put the element on our webpage the way we want it to be or the way it would look great and eye-catching. For me, the topic I liked the most this quarter is the last topic or Lesson 7. It wasn't discussed but it contained a lot of information that I can use when I am coding. Many topics this quarter were confusing, too. As a person who isn't fond of coding, it was really challenging — just like in the last quarters. But thankfully, I have my friends and classmates who are more than willing to help me learn every topic. The people that surrounded me this quarter makde it bearable, and surely did make life worth living. 
<br><br> 
In conclusion, even though this is the busiest quarter so far, I enjoyed many things that happened this quarter. All of them led me to grow and discover more of what I can do. This quarter wasn't perfect either, but I'll make sure to correct my wrongdoings to ensure a better quarter in the third grading. I will take more time to practice coding next quarter to promise my improvement, and I will do my best to study harder to make myself and my loved ones proud.  
<br> <br> 
<b> To Ms. Uminga, thank you po for your patience and understanding this quarter. To my friends, thank you for being there for me in every step of the way. To my family, who served as my motivation, thank you for love and support. And lastly, to the Lord, for His guidance always. Thanks be to God!
