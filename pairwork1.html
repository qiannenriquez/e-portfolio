  <h1> THE FOX AND THE GRAPES </h1>
  <div class="Para1">
  <p>
    A Fox one day spied a beautiful <br>
    bunch of ripe grapes hanging <br>
    From a vine trained along the <br>
    branches of a tree. The grapes seemed <br>
    Ready to burst with juice, and the <br>
    Fox's mouth watered as me gazed longingly at them. <br> </p> </div>
  <div class="Para2">   
  <p> 
    The bunch hung from a high branch, and the <br>
    Fox had to jump for it. The first time he jumped <br>
    He missed it by a long way. So he walked off a short <br>
    distance and took a running leap at it, only to fall short once more. <br>
    Again and again he tried, but in vain. <br>
    Now he sat down and looked at the grapes in disgust. <br> <br> </p> </div>
   
  <div class="Para3">
    <p>
    "What a fool I am," he said. <br>
    "Here I am wearing myself out to get a bunch of <br>
    sour grapes that are not worth gaping for." <br>
    And off he walked very, very scornfully. <br> 
    <i> "There are many who pretend to despise and <br>
    belittle that which is beyond their reach." </i> <br> </p> </div>
